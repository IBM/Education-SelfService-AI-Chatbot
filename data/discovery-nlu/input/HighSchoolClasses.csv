Abstract Algebra Open Learning Course,,,"Algebra is the language of modern mathematics. This course introduces students to that language through a study of groups, group actions, vector spaces, linear algebra, and the theory of fields. In these free videotaped lectures, Professor Gross presents an array of algebraic concepts.",,https://www.extension.harvard.edu/open-learning-initiative/abstract-algebra
OTH011 SUMMIT PERSONAL HEALTH,,,"In this course students will study physical, emotional, mental, and social health. They will study how to maintain and improve all facets of health while learning about disease and illness prevention. Students will also study the effects of tobacco, alcohol, and substance abuse for the individual as well as communities. In addition to their reading lessons, students complete a variety of activities, assignments, quizzes, and tests to assess their understanding of the content studied.",,https://www.k12.com/high-school-courses.html#high-school/course-details2/5d3202c1ffee6b0010f6ba80/
BUS032 SUMMIT INTRODUCTORY FINANCE,,,"Understanding financial management concepts is an important life skill. From credit to insurance to taxes, it is imperative that students understand the consequences of their choices. Wisely managing their money, students become citizens that are more responsible. A thorough understanding of financial concepts, with practical application through activities and projects, will enable students to leave this course with applicable, useful skills for life. This course surveys the basic personal financial needs of most individuals and emphasizes the basics of budgeting, saving, checking, investments, credit, the wise use of insurance, and paying and preparing income tax returns. After high school, students face a world filled with possibilities, and the more knowledge they can acquire, the higher the probability that their financial future will be secure. Students taking this course will learn to better prepare for their financial futures.",,https://www.k12.com/high-school-courses.html#high-school/course-details2/5cf5296fdaf2ad000ab640f9/
ART500-CEN AP ART HISTORY,,,"AP® Art History is two semesters long with 180 days of instruction. Each lesson is designed as a 45-minute block of learning time. Every unit is planned to represent at least one of the 10 content areas required by the College Board. A pacing guide is provided to instructors to explain which works of art should be included in each unit, with some flexibility allowed. Students explore a wide range of art, from the earliest works made by prehistoric ancestors in caves to the soaring cathedrals of the Gothic era and beyond. As they study painting, sculpture, architecture, and other artwork across cultures, students acquire tools for careful observation and analysis of visual expression. This course provides opportunities for students to practice new visual vocabulary and concepts through engaging discussions, relevant research, and reports about museum experiences. Course learning objectives and enduring understanding statements that support the three big ideas for AP Art History are integrated into each unit. Instructional activities build student skills to ensure that they master the essential knowledge statements. Students will build on these foundations as they explore works of art, scholarly resources, primary and secondary source documents, videos, museums, and virtual museum visits.",,https://www.k12.com/high-school-courses.html#high-school/course-details2/5b589874291b925343be1490/
TCH047 WEB DESIGN 1,,,"TCH047 Web Design is a CodeHS course that teaches students how to build their own web pages. Students will learn the languages HTML and CSS, and will create their own live homepages to serve as portfolios of their creations. By the end of this course, students will be able to explain how web pages are developed and viewed on the Internet, analyze and fix errors in existing websites, and create their very own multi page websites. Students will learn the foundations of user interface design, rapid prototyping and user testing, and will work together to create professional, mobile responsive websites.",,https://www.k12.com/high-school-courses.html#high-school/course-details2/5cc4845811f5350006ab1003/
Fundamentals of Biology,,,"Fundamentals of Biology focuses on the basic principles of biochemistry, molecular biology, genetics, and recombinant DNA. These principles are necessary to understanding the basic mechanisms of life and anchor the biological knowledge that is required to understand many of the challenges in everyday life, from human health and disease to loss of biodiversity and environmental quality.",,https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/biology/7-01sc-fundamentals-of-biology-fall-2011/
Geobiology,,,"This course introduces the parallel evolution of life and the environment. Life processes are influenced by chemical and physical processes in the atmosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere and the solid earth. In turn, life can influence chemical and physical processes on our planet. This course explores the concept of life as a geological agent and examines the interaction between biology and the earth system during the roughly 4 billion years since life first appeared.",,https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/earth-atmospheric-and-planetary-sciences/12-007-geobiology-spring-2013/
Drugs and the Brain,,,"From Abilify to Zyrtec, the world is full of fascinating drugs. If you are poisoned by sarin nerve gas, you may be able to save your life by huffing some BZ nerve gas. This class will explain that chemical curiosity, along with a host of other interesting tidbits of pharmacology. The structure of the class interleaves basic concepts with specific examples and entertaining tangents, so it is not loaded with boring abstract theory. In the first class you will learn what a neurotransmitter is, and you will immediately apply that knowledge when we discuss the mechanism of caffeine. The class is highly multidisciplinary, including topics such as patent law, medical ethics, history, and the physics of crack pipes.",,https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/experimental-study-group/es-s10-drugs-and-the-brain-spring-2013/
Bioengineering,,,Bioengineering at MIT is represented by the diverse curricula offered by most Departments in the School of Engineering. This course samples the wide variety of bioengineering options for students who plan to major in one of the undergraduate Engineering degree programs. The beginning lectures describe the science basis for bioengineering with particular emphasis on molecular cell biology and systems biology. Bioengineering faculty will then describe the bioengineering options in a particular engineering course as well as the type of research conducted by faculty in the department.,,https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/biological-engineering/20-010j-introduction-to-bioengineering-be-010j-spring-2006/
STAR: Software Tools for Academics and Researchers,,,"The Software Tools for Academics and Researchers (STAR) program at MIT seeks to bridge the divide between scientific research and the classroom. Understanding and applying research methods in the classroom setting can be challenging due to time constraints and the need for advanced equipment and facilities. The multidisciplinary STAR team collaborates with faculty from MIT and other educational institutions to design software exploring core scientific research concepts. The goal of STAR is to develop innovative and intuitive teaching tools for classroom use. All of the STAR educational tools are freely available. To complement the educational software, the STAR website contains curriculum components/modules which can facilitate the use of STAR educational tools in a variety of educational settings. Students, teachers, and professors should feel welcome to download software and curriculum modules for their own use.",,https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-tl-002-star-software-tools-for-academics-and-researchers-spring-2012/
