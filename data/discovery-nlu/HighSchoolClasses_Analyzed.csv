3,ART500-CEN AP ART HISTORY,"AP® Art History is two semesters long with 180 days of instruction. Each lesson is designed as a 45-minute block of learning time. Every unit is planned to represent at least one of the 10 content areas required by the College Board. A pacing guide is provided to instructors to explain which works of art should be included in each unit, with some flexibility allowed. Students explore a wide range of art, from the earliest works made by prehistoric ancestors in caves to the soaring cathedrals of the Gothic era and beyond. As they study painting, sculpture, architecture, and other artwork across cultures, students acquire tools for careful observation and analysis of visual expression. This course provides opportunities for students to practice new visual vocabulary and concepts through engaging discussions, relevant research, and reports about museum experiences. Course learning objectives and enduring understanding statements that support the three big ideas for AP Art History are integrated into each unit. Instructional activities build student skills to ensure that they master the essential knowledge statements. Students will build on these foundations as they explore works of art, scholarly resources, primary and secondary source documents, videos, museums, and virtual museum visits.","['Instructional activities build student skills', 'pacing guide', 'Art History', 'works of art', 'Students', 'understanding statements', 'wide range of art', 'careful observation', 'course', 'big ideas', 'new visual vocabulary', 'scholarly resources', 'College Board', 'lesson', 'painting', 'AP Art History', 'unit', 'AP', 'analysis of visual expression', 'sculpture', 'architecture', 'secondary source documents', 'art', 'artwork', 'objectives', 'opportunities', 'cultures', 'foundations', 'prehistoric ancestors', '45-minute block', 'instructors', 'concepts', 'essential knowledge statements', 'tools', 'discussions', 'caves', 'videos', 'semesters', 'reports', 'flexibility', 'museums', 'content areas', 'soaring cathedrals of the Gothic era', 'relevant research', 'museum experiences', 'virtual museum visits', 'days of instruction', 'time']","['Learning', 'Museum', 'Knowledge', 'Art', 'Modernism', 'Scientific method', 'Sculpture', 'Formalism']",https://www.k12.com/high-school-courses.html#high-school/course-details2/5b589874291b925343be1490/

5,Fundamentals of Biology,"Fundamentals of Biology focuses on the basic principles of biochemistry, molecular biology, genetics, and recombinant DNA. These principles are necessary to understanding the basic mechanisms of life and anchor the biological knowledge that is required to understand many of the challenges in everyday life, from human health and disease to loss of biodiversity and environmental quality.","['basic principles of biochemistry', 'Fundamentals of Biology focuses', 'molecular biology', 'basic mechanisms of life', 'everyday life', 'human health', 'biological knowledge', 'recombinant DNA', 'environmental quality', 'principles', 'challenges', 'disease', 'genetics', 'loss of biodiversity']","['DNA', 'Evolution', 'Molecular biology', 'Biology', 'Epidemiology', 'Gene', 'Medicine', 'Genetics']",https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/biology/7-01sc-fundamentals-of-biology-fall-2011/
6,Geobiology,"This course introduces the parallel evolution of life and the environment. Life processes are influenced by chemical and physical processes in the atmosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere and the solid earth. In turn, life can influence chemical and physical processes on our planet. This course explores the concept of life as a geological agent and examines the interaction between biology and the earth system during the roughly 4 billion years since life first appeared.","['parallel evolution of life', 'Life processes', 'physical processes', 'course', 'geological agent', 'concept of life', 'solid earth', 'life', 'biology', 'interaction', 'atmosphere', 'planet', 'environment', 'earth system', 'turn', 'hydrosphere', 'cryosphere']","['Earth', 'Evolution', 'Atmosphere', 'Life', 'Planet', 'Ecology', 'Paleontology', 'Geography']",https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/earth-atmospheric-and-planetary-sciences/12-007-geobiology-spring-2013/
